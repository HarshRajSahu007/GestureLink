"Real-Time Sign Language Translation Agent with Context-Aware Assistance"

Technical Stack:

AI Agents + RAG + LangChain + CV + NLP
Why This Topic?

High Impact & Inclusivity: Bridges communication gaps for the deaf/hard-of-hearing by translating sign language (CV) to text/speech (NLP) and providing contextual assistance via RAG.
Cutting-Edge Fusion: Combines real-time CV for sign recognition, NLP for bidirectional translation, and RAG to fetch dynamic information (e.g., emergency protocols, job listings, educational content).
Everyday Relevance: Enables seamless interaction in healthcare, education, and public services, empowering users to access critical information independently.
Implementation Strategy

Sign Language Recognition (CV):
Use lightweight pose estimation models (e.g., MediaPipe, OpenPose) to detect hand/body movements in real-time video.
Train a custom model on regional sign language datasets (e.g., ASL, ISL) for accuracy.
Conversational Agent (NLP + LangChain):
Convert detected signs to text using sequence models (e.g., Transformers).
Generate vocal responses (text-to-speech) for hearing users.
Use LangChain to orchestrate workflows (e.g., trigger RAG for queries like “Find nearby deaf-friendly clinics”).
Contextual Knowledge (RAG):
Integrate RAG with databases (e.g., government health portals, disaster response guides) to retrieve real-time, localized information.
Example: If a user signs “Earthquake safety,” RAG fetches the latest evacuation routes and relief camps.
Two-Way Communication:
Add a CV component to animate sign language avatars from text input, enabling bidirectional dialogue.
